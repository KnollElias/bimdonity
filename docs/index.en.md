# bimdonity - Knowledge Network for BIM!

Welcome to the exciting world of Building Information Modeling! 🌍
As the community part of the bimdoer platform, we offer freely accessible BIM knowledge for everyone on GitHub - whether you're new to BIM or an experienced bimdoer. 🚀

## Focus & Content
bimdonity focuses on practical BIM knowledge with special emphasis on:

- **Practical Workflows**: Proven workflows for everyday BIM use
- **Software Tutorials**: Guides for Archicad, Grasshopper, Blender and other tools
- **Exchange Formats**: IFC, BCF and other open standards
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing procedures and validation methods
- **Process Optimization**: Automation of recurring tasks

We focus on solutions that have been tested in real projects, rather than theoretical concepts. The emphasis is on concrete assistance for all BIM users from beginners to experts, with a particular focus on benefiting SMEs. Unlike commercial offerings, the focus here is on fundamental knowledge that should be accessible to everyone.

## Our Story
It all began with [**bimdo.ch**](https://bimdo.ch) - a blog with experiences from planning management. The motivation was clear: BIM was often perceived as a black box in projects. Beautiful marketing presentations contrasted with practical implementation, which meant a lot of experimenting and weekend work.

From the blog, our [**bimdoer YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@bimdoer) evolved and finally our [**bimdoer**](https://bimdo.ch/bimdoer) - a combination of Archicad template and tutorial platform launching this summer. While we offer services and tutorials for architects with bimdoer, bimdonity remains the free knowledge base on GitHub.
