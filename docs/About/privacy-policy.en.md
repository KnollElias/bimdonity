## 4. Method and Place of Data Processing

**Processing Methods**

The provider processes users' personal data properly and takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access and the unauthorized forwarding, modification, or destruction of data.

Data processing is carried out using computers or IT-based systems, following organizational procedures and methods specifically targeting the stated purposes. In addition to the data controller, in some cases, other persons internal to the organization (personnel administration, sales, marketing, legal department, system administrators) or external – and in that case, where necessary, appointed as data processors by the data controller (such as technical service providers, delivery companies, hosting providers, IT companies, or communications agencies) - may have access to the data. An up-to-date list of these parties can be requested from the provider at any time.

**Location**

The data is processed at the provider's operating locations and at all other locations where the parties involved in the processing are located.

Depending on the user's location, data transfers may involve transferring the user's data to a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred data, users can refer to the section with detailed information on the processing of personal data.

**Retention Time**

Unless otherwise specified in this document, personal data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose for which it was collected and may be retained longer due to an applicable legal obligation or based on the user's consent.

---

## 5. Purposes of Processing

Personal data about the user is collected so that the provider can provide the service and further fulfill its legal obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of users or third parties), detect malicious or fraudulent activities. In addition, data is collected for the following purposes: displaying content from external platforms, analytics, interaction with external social networks and platforms, managing productivity processes, contacting the user, registration and authentication directly through this website, and optimizing and distributing traffic.

Users can find further detailed information on these processing purposes and the specific personal data used for each purpose in the section "Detailed Information on the Processing of Personal Data" of this document.

## 7. Additional Information for Users
**Legal Basis for Processing**

The provider may process personal data relating to users only if one of the following applies:

- Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes.
- The data collection is necessary for the performance of a contract with the user and/or for pre-contractual measures;
- Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the provider is subject;
- Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the provider;
- Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the provider or by a third party.

In any case, the provider will gladly help clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

**Additional Information on Retention Time**

Unless otherwise specified in this document, personal data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose for which it was collected and may be retained longer due to an applicable legal obligation or based on the user's consent.

Therefore:

Personal data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the provider and the user shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.

Personal data collected for the purposes of the provider's legitimate interests shall be retained for as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the provider within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the provider.

In addition, the provider may be obliged to retain personal data for a longer period whenever required to fulfill a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.

Once the retention period expires, personal data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.

**The Rights of Users under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**

Users may exercise certain rights regarding their data processed by the provider.

In particular, users have the right to do the following, to the extent permitted by law:

- Withdraw their consent at any time. If the user previously consented to the processing of personal data, they may withdraw their own consent at any time.
- Object to the processing of their data. The user has the right to object to the processing of their data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent.
- Access their data. The user has the right to learn if data is being processed by the provider, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing, and obtain a copy of the data undergoing processing.
- Verify and seek rectification. The user has the right to verify the accuracy of their data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.
- Restrict the processing of their data. The users have the right to restrict the processing of their data. In this case, the provider will not process the data for any purpose other than storing it.
- Have their personal data deleted or otherwise removed. The users have the right to obtain the erasure of their data from the provider.
- Receive their data and have it transferred to another controller. The user has the right to receive their data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.
- Lodge a complaint. The users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection authority.

Users also have the right to be informed about the legal basis for data transfers abroad or to an international organization governed by public international law or established by two or more countries, such as the UN, as well as about the security measures taken by the provider to safeguard their data.

**Details on the Right to Object to Processing**

Where personal data is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in the provider, or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the provider, users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.

Users are informed that, however, should their personal data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn whether the provider is processing personal data for direct marketing purposes, users may refer to the relevant sections of this document.

**How to Exercise These Rights**

Any requests to exercise user rights can be directed to the owner through the contact information provided in this document. These requests can be made free of charge and will be addressed by the owner as early as possible, at the latest within one month, providing users with the legally prescribed information. Any correction or deletion of personal data or restriction of processing will be communicated by the provider to all recipients to whom personal data has been disclosed, if any. Unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort, the provider will inform the user about these recipients if the user requests it.
