When exchanging with the structural engineer, it's important to reduce the architectural model to the load-bearing elements and concrete work. ArchiCAD offers the structural display for this, which allows the cores of the load-bearing elements to be displayed in isolation. While this works automatically with most elements and hides non-load-bearing layers, the staircase still requires some tricks. In this video, I show you the different options for the correct IFC representation of stairs.
