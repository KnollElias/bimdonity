This video explains the strategic positioning of BIM in the construction process and shows its interconnection with other areas. The VDC framework (Virtual Design & Construction) positions BIM as a link between three core aspects:

- Integral collaboration of project participants
- Optimized processes and workflows
- Measurable project and customer goals

Through this holistic approach, concrete added values can be demonstrated and quantified throughout the entire project cycle.
